scireum OpenSource Library
--------------------------

This project contains open sourced components from our production
codebase. They have minor source-modifications since we use or
DIY dependency injection framework. However the better part of
this code is running in large multi-tenant (insert fancy cloud 
buzzword here) web applications 24/7 (more or less) and can be
considered pretty stable.

The idea is, that you can pick up the useful bits and directly
integrate those in your codebase (yep also in commercial ones).
Feel free to rename classes and packages. Also feel free to contribute
and send patches.
